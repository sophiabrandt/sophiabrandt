<h1>Hi. 👋</h1>
<p>I'm Sophia Brandt. I'm a former tax officer turned software developer from Germany.</p>
<p>I currently work at an IT service provider. I also volunteer as a mentor for the Zero to Mastery Academy, home to over 300k students learning to code.<br>
When I was on parental leave, I started teaching myself to code - and I never looked back. 💜</p>
<p>I enjoy learning new programming languages, language learning (currently Esperanto), reading and writing.</p>
